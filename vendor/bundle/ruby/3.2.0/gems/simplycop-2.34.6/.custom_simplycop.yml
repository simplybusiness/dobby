CustomCops/TimecopWithoutBlock:
  Enabled: true
  Details: >-
    Time in all tests is faked to be midday. Using `Timecop.return` rather than the block format will spoil that for all subsequent tests.

CustomCops/DontPrintAllEnv:
  Enabled: true
  Details: >-
    This cop checks if someone accidentally print all environment variables as they may contain secrets.

CustomCops/NoForegroundIndices:
  Enabled: true
  Details: We want to prevent adding Mongoid indices that are not in background, otherwise the collection will lock during indexing.

  Include:
    - app/models/*

CustomCops/VariableNameShadowingMethod:
  Enabled: true
  Details: >-
    This cop checks for local variable assignments that shadow method names in the same scope.
    This can cause subtle bugs where the variable returns nil instead of calling the method,
    since Ruby determines local variable scope at parse time, not runtime.

CustomCops/VersionComparison:
  Enabled: true
  Details: >-
    This cop checks for string-based version comparisons which can produce incorrect results.
    Use Gem::Version for reliable version comparisons.
